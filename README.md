# Landing Page Project

This project is a landing page website created as part of The Odin Project's foundations course. The goal was to build an entire webpage from the provided design. It's a simple site, but it's built using the core HTML and CSS skills I've learned so far.

## Skills Demonstrated

Once completed, this project will have demonstrated the following skills:

* **HTML Structure:** Using semantic HTML to create distinct sections of a webpage, including a header, body content, and a footer.
* **Flexbox for Layout:** This was the primary focus of the project. I used Flexbox to:
	* Structure the overall page layout.
	* Align items horizontally and vertically.
	* Create complex components like the header, information cards, and footer.
	* Control the spacing and positioning of elements.
* **CSS Styling:** Applying fonts, colours, and sizing to match a design specification.
* **Working with Elements:** Using a variety of elements like divs, buttons, images, and lists to build a complete page.
* **Git & GitHub:** Using Git for version control and pushing the project to a GitHub repository.

## Self-Reflection

This project was a significant step up from previous exercises because it was my first time using Flexbox to build a complete page layout from a design image. The biggest challenge was thinking in terms of "containers" and "items" and figuring out how to nest flex containers to get the desired result. The header and the four information cards were particularly good practice for this.
There was a real "aha!" moment when I started to see how `justify-content` and `align-items` could be used to precisely position elements. I learned that adding extra `div` containers is often necessary to group items before you can align them correctly. This project really helped solidify my understanding of how to translate a static design into a flexible, responsive webpage.
